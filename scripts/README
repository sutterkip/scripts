                                using $HOME/adfdev

castep-grab-*                   various scripts to get coordinates
                                and NMR shielding info from a castep 
                                output. Print NMR tensor in Mathematica
                                format.

				extension. Useful for creating file names
				for series of benchmark jobs

                                prefix. Useful for creating file names
                                for series of benchmark jobs

create-adf-nbonmr.sh		takes ADF input file and creates a series
				of jobs for spin-orbit NMR analysis with NBO

create-adf-nboefg.sh            takes ADF input file and creates a series
                                of jobs for scalar EFG analysis with NBO

g03-finalgeo-standardorientation.pl extract geometry from Gaussian log file

qsub-all			submits all .pbs files in a directory

random_string			create random string of characters
				(sometimes useful for job file creation
				or creation of randomly names scratch dirs)

process-cpl-data2.awk		processes adf J-coupling results from CPL
				use on the output file

remove-even-lines		copies only odd line numbers from a text file
				to stdout

remove-odd-lines		copies only even line numbers from a text file
                                to stdout 

rotate-file			renames foo.bar to foo.bar.1
                                if foo.bar.1 exists it will be renamed
				to foo.bar.2, etc up to .9.
				useful to keep old ouputs for a job, etc

rotate-outputs			renames all files out.* and *.out
				in a directory using rotate-file. Useful
				if rerunning lots of jobs and keeping old
				outputs
